## üîç Description
This repository contains another one of my assignments, which was to create my portfolio using the very latest, popular, novel and sophisticated <b>React.js</b>  framework. This app has all the information about myself, for employers to have a look at and then consider me as a potential candidate for the position that I apply for. It includes my life story, achievements, hobbies and interests, my repositories, and my contact information, along with my LinkedIn, my CV and my Github.

There are three main pages in this website (accessible via the Reactdtrap navbar toggle):
1. <b>About</b> - Read all about me and have a look at my repositories:

## üíª Usage
This portfolio has been made far more advanced and modernized as compared to the last ones I submitted as a part of my course criteria. it has made use of very sophisticated programming tools, listed below:

1. React JS Framework
2. JavaScript for logic
3. Bootstrap/Reactstrap and CSS for styling
4. Axios library for front-end request, when my portfolio viewer fills out the contact form and submits it
5. Express, Cors, Nodemailer and bodyParser to handle back-end response in the server, so that the submission is received by myself via email
6. Dotenv to store sensitive information
7. React-dom from React libraries, for page connections 
8. React Hooks, for page functionality, in functional components

The app has been deployed using heroku.
